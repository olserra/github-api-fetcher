<!-- Setup a standard/generic Ruby on Rails project

> The project should allow to retrieve information from different profiles from GitHub and store it in a database
Here you can choose to retrieve personal profiles or project profiles via GitHub API

> We should be able to see what profiles/projects are stored in your database

> We should be able to select two profiles/projects and present a visual comparison between them

The project can be broken down into three views: Get/Fetch profiles, view stored profiles, profiles compare

Explain how you did it (git commits are a good way to show how you evolved)
NICE TO HAVE: You´ll get some bonus point if the project is deployed and executed it in a production environment
